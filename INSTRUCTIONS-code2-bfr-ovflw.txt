# INSTRUCTIONS FOR RUNNING BUFFEROVERFLOW PROGRAMS
(Barry Smith - CS166 - SEPT 18, 2018)

These programs can be run by simply typing:

python3 bufferOverflow.py 

and

python3 bufferOverflowSafe.py

These programs are simply modifications of the program from the previous assignment. The program bufferOverflow.py, when given a username of over 25 letters, will simulate a crash and exit. The program bufferOverflowSafe.py will monitor the length of the username field - any username over 25 letters will warn the user of the limited username length and exit.

Otherwise, once running the programs, the menus will be self-explanatory.
