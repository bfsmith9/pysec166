# JIM EDDY'S INSTRUCTIONS FOR ASSIGNMENT 1
Assignment 1.0
Write a Python program: Create a login and menu to a company intranet system that requires users (employees) to enter a username and password in order to view a menu of options (such as Time Reporting, Accounting, IT Helpdesk, Engineering Documents, etc. ). 

Technical requirements:

1 Plaintext usernames/passwords/access level stored in a csv (or text) file
2 Create three different access levels (roles for different users). For example, User A should have access to all menu items ('admin' access), while User B has limited access (no Accounting or Engineering Documents), etc. 
3 Once logged in the user should be able to select different menu options with a number input (for example, "press 1 for the Time Reporting area", "press 2 for the Accounting area", etc.).
4 When a user enters a menu area they have access to, a simple message similar to 'You have now accessed the accounting application' is sufficient to indicate a successful demonstration of the access control (no need to build out any actual accounting functionality). Likewise, if a user does not have the appropriate access level to view a menu area, the program should display a 'You are not authorized to access this area.' message and provide an option to return them to the main menu.
5 Good programming practices: Reasonable amount of error/exception handling. Must organize code into functions. Well-documented. Written in Python 3. No GUI necessary, this should be a command menu driven program.

Please submit a compressed folder containing all of the files associated with your assignment, as well as instructions for testing your program. Note: you will be adding functionality to this system in subsequent assignments, so take your time and plan out your design.

# EXAMPLE I WROTE:

Python 3.7.0 (v3.7.0:1bf9cc5093, Jun 26 2018, 23:26:24)

>>> areas={}
>>> areas['john'] = {}
>>> areas['john']['pass'] = 'dog'
>>> areas['john']['level'] = '1'
>>> areas
{'john': {'pass': 'dog', 'level': '1'}}
>>> areas['judy'] = {}
>>> areas['judy']['pass'] = 'cat'
>>> areas['judy']['level'] = '4'
>>> areas
{'john': {'pass': 'dog', 'level': '1'}, 'judy': {'pass': 'cat', 'level': '4'}}

Something I was playing with that didn't look right:
{'John': {'baptist': '2'}, 'Mary': {'virgin': '1'}}
